# Embracing the Small Web

*The web doesn't have to be slow, bloated, or invasive. This site proves that you can create something beautiful, functional, and fast while respecting your visitors' time, privacy, and bandwidth.*

This website is a proud member of the **small web** — a movement that champions simplicity, sustainability, and human-scale technology over the bloated, surveillance-heavy platforms that dominate today's internet.

## What is the Small Web?

The small web represents a return to the original vision of the World Wide Web: a decentralized network of independent websites, each with its own character and purpose. It's about:

- **Personal ownership:** Your content, your domain, your rules
- **Simplicity over complexity:** Fast-loading pages that work everywhere
- **Privacy by design:** No tracking, no data harvesting, no surveillance capitalism
- **Environmental responsibility:** Lightweight sites that consume less energy
- **Accessibility first:** Content that everyone can access and enjoy
- **Human scale:** Technology that serves people, not corporations

## Why This Matters

In an era where a handful of tech giants control most of our online interactions, the small web offers an alternative. It's a space where:

> Creativity flourishes without algorithmic interference. Where you can discover genuine human voices instead of engagement-optimized content. Where your attention isn't the product being sold.

Every small website is an act of digital resistance — a declaration that the web can be better, more humane, and more sustainable.

## Join the Movement

You don't need to be a developer to participate in the small web. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Create your own website:** Use simple tools like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), or even hand-coded HTML
- **Support independent creators:** Visit personal blogs, subscribe to RSS feeds, share interesting content
- **Choose sustainable hosting:** Use green hosting providers or static site hosts
- **Keep it simple:** Resist the urge to add unnecessary complexity
- **Link generously:** Connect to other small websites and help the web stay interconnected
- **Own your content:** Post on your own site first, then syndicate elsewhere
