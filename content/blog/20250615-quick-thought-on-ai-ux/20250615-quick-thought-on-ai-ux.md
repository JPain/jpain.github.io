Just noticed how AI chat interfaces are becoming the new modal dialog - everywhere and often poorly implemented.

Every app seems to think they need a chatbot now, but most of them feel like they're just replacing perfectly good forms with a more annoying conversation. 

The ones that work well understand the user's context and intent. The bad ones make you explain what you want in natural language when a button would have been clearer.

Maybe the real innovation isn't adding chat everywhere, but knowing when NOT to use it.
