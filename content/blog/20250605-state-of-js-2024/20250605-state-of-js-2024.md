The State of JS 2024 results just dropped: [https://stateofjs.com/2024/](https://stateofjs.com/2024/)

Some interesting takeaways:

- **Astro** continues its meteoric rise - now at 83% satisfaction rate
- **Solid** is gaining serious traction, especially among React developers looking for performance
- **Vite** has basically won the bundler wars - 98% would use again
- **TypeScript** adoption is slowing, but stabilizing at around 75%

The most surprising finding: **Vanilla JS** is making a comeback for smaller projects. Seems like developer fatigue with complex toolchains is real.

Also worth noting the growing interest in **WASM** - 34% want to learn it, up from 22% last year.

Worth a read if you're trying to stay on top of where the ecosystem is heading.
